However, it was never actualized until 2009 and when the real code was developed. However, the surprising thing is that no one owns the king of cryptocurrencies – the bitcoin. The first interesting fact about cryptocurrency: It is credited to Satoshi Nakamoto but there is not real connection. He has not even claimed ownership of the code. This is an ecosystem that is open for people to mine and get commissions as well as rewards. If you are looking for the owner, you will not get anytime soon.", "Small Fractions Of Bitcoin Are Called Satoshi: Cyrptocurrencies like bitcoins can be broken down into fractions. This allows buyers to invest in 1/10 of a currency. For instance, if the value of Ethereum is $100, you can buy ½ or ¼. This is an opportunity for many people to invest and gain value over time. It also presents a chance for small scale investors to participate in the cryptocurrency market.", "Someone Paid For A Pizza Using 10,000 BTC: This is one of the unbelievable facts about cryptocurrency and specifically Bitcoin. A developer used 10,000 bitcoins to pay for 2 pizzas in 2010. That only points at how far the coin and generally the market have come. In December of 2017, that would have translated to $179,000,000. This would have been enough to buy a Picasso painting that cost that amount back in 2015. This points at growing interest in cryptocurrencies and their volatility over the years. This was 20 million dollars more than the brand value of Arsenal football club by 2017. Imagine buying a global soccer concern for only 2 pizzas in 2010.", "If You Lose Your Wallet, You Have Lost Your Money: The value of your bitcoins or cryptocurrency lies in your wallet. If you lose the wallet or access details to your wallet, you have lost your currency. This is because of the absence of a central point where the codes can be generated. It means that once you lose the current code, you have no place to get another. You should keep your access codes safe and away from unnecessary exposure. You can use an online wallet, paper or a physical one to store your wallets.", "The Real Value Of Cryptocurrency Lies In Their Blockchain: The value of currencies lies in the technology that is used during storage and transactions. This is a digital platform that is also decentralized. The ledger records all transactions and gives a history of all activity on a coin. This technology makes the coins safe and efficient to use. This technology has made investors so excited about the currencies.", "They Operate 24/7: Blockchain technology presents more advantages than the fact that it is decentralized. The technology operates 24hrs and 7days in a week. This is unlike traditional banking systems where you have to wait for the next working day to have your transaction approved. This is what has endeared many minors to the technology. The absence of a middleman also reduces transaction costs. Both parties have control over the direction of a transaction. This guarantees safety of investor monies. The future of blockchain technology also lies in the users and not a third party.", "A Number Of Countries Have Outlawed Cryptocurrencies: Cryptocurrencies may have captured the minds and captivation of investment markets, but have they still yet to be accepted by governments worldwide. Nations wary of these coins, due to their unregulated and decentralized nature has prompted some nations to ban the trade and use of these coins for public safety, including Bolivia, Bangladesh, Nepal, Morocco, Ecuador and Kyrgyzstan. It is likely that the number of countries to outlaw digital currencies will grow, which includes Russia, which has considered banning Bitcoin and its derivatives for some time.", "Types of Blockchain? There are three types of Blockchain. Private, Public and Consortium. The private Blockchain is the decentralized blockchain under the charge of a company i.e it is controlled by a certain set of individuals. You need some level of authorization to access the records in a private blockchain. A public blockchain is the decentralized database that has no restrictions. Anyone can validate or make transactions.", "What type of records can the Blockchain store? There is no restriction to how the blockchain can be used in the storing of records. Blockchain can used to store health records, business transactions, management records, financial records and so many others.", "What exactly is a Blockchain? A blockchain is a decentralized database in which records are stored. It is public (transactions stored are seen by all), immutable (the records stored cannot be changed), secure and private (the identity of users are protected), fast and sure and so can be trusted for use by large and small companies. With the aim of creating a technology to store records, the use of blockchain came up with the invention of the first ever known cryptocurrency.", "What Real Life Scenarios/Application Can The Blockchain Technology Be Applied? Election processes, Stock Market, Financial Institutions…Ehmm, actually, there is no limit to the use and application of Blockchain in the real world.", "Mining? Are we digging up the internet for some coins? Mining is the process of validating transactions to be stored on the blockchain. Miners are often rewarded with a token or portion of cryptocurrency. Mining includes two functions, namely: adding transactions to the blockchain (securing and verifying) and also releasing/generating new currency.", "We use Blockchain because: It is secure, It is immutable, Saves time and cost, Protects the users’ identity, Reduced transaction fees and time, Suitable for storage, Transparency, No need for intermediaries, Everyone has access to data available on the blockchain, It is useful for a whole wide range of limitless applications in several industries.", "What Is Encryption? Encryption exists to provide data security and ensures that data sent or stored is jumbled up (encrypted) in such a way that no one but the receiver with the private key can read it. This adds to the authenticity of the blocks in the chain and helps to keep them secure.", "What Is Gas? Apart from the gas you use to fill your car or heat your home when you hear people talking about gas in the cryptosphere, they’re talking about the unit used in Ethereum to execute smart contracts. It measures how much work an action takes and monetizes it. You basically pay for your time on the Ethereum blockchain with gas. Every operation costs a certain amount of gas. So, just as when filling your car for a long journey, the amount of miles you do affects the amount of gas you need in the tank, the same is applied here. The more complex operations and contracts are, the more computational resources used, the higher the cost of gas.",];
